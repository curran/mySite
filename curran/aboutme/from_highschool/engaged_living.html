Engaged Living<br>
1/15/2005<br>
      <br>
&#8220;Someone within 200 feet of us right now will probably win the Nobel
Prize within the next five years,&#8221; said Bill Theurkauf. We were
standing in his biotech lab where I have been a research assistant
since June. He was referring to scientists in our building who
conducted founding research on RNAi; a powerful gene silencing tool.
Hearing these words, I was in disbelief that I was so close to such
accomplished people. This situation is one of many that have made me
realize that everything in this world is really there, and the
potential for me to get involved is also there. It is difficult to say
exactly when or why this realization occurred, but since that time and
more so with every day, I am living in a more engaged way.<br>
      <br>
I had no reason to be engaged until I discovered music; it changed my
life! I finally found something that genuinely captured my interest.
Music forced me to think in an organized manner and has been an
extraordinary catalyst for my evolution as a person. What has
fascinated me in music is the physics of it and its logical depth. This
complicated thing can be easily perceived and interpreted by the human
brain and even be a medium through which emotions are communicated. The
further you go in trying to understand music, the more music becomes
science. This has led me to shift my efforts to pursue science with the
same enthusiasm and inspiration I had when I first discovered music.<br>
      <br>
I developed serious interest in science during my junior year biology
class. I took an opportunity to volunteer as a research assistant at
UMass Medical School that summer. We are currently working on
understanding specific proteins involved with RNAi, objectively probing
the inner workings of nature. The more exposure I have to science, with
its profound relevance and fascinating complexity, the more I want
immerse myself in it. This desire is the dark energy that is
accelerating my universe outward.<br>
      <br>
My experiences have led me to the realization that I have the ability
to self-learn. I first applied this to my music studies and guitar
performance, then later to math, science, and academics. Music is a
gift I possess and can further develop at any time. Science requires
building on layers of understanding that can only be achieved through
progressive instruction and continued self-learning. My immediate goal
is to pursue science through formal education as well as independent
study.<br>
      <br>
My ultimate goal is to realize my full potential as a human being, no
matter how hard I must work, and no matter the sacrifices. At this
point in my life, I must learn everything I possibly can. In the future
I hope to return what I have learned to the world in an effort to
better humankind. My world is one filled with opportunity and support,
for that I am grateful. This world has not only shaped my dreams and
aspirations, but has allowed me to become engaged.</td>

In July 2005, I took a trip to Oregon. I stayed in Astoria with my uncle for 9 
days, and took a 1000 mile road trip in his 1985 Corvette

<p>THE ROAD TRIP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Day 1. I went from Astoria, to Portland, west along the Columbia river to 
Hood River, headed west to Mt Hood

    <IMG src="photo_gallery/thumbnails/_102%20mt%20hood.jpg" border="0" alt="_102 mt hood" align="BOTTOM" width="200" height="149"></A>, through the Warm Springs high desert Indian 
Reservation

    <IMG src="photo_gallery/thumbnails/_corvette%20at%20Indian%20reservation.jpg" border="0" alt="_corvette at Indian reservation" align="BOTTOM" width="200" height="149"></A>, onward through nowhere to Bend, then to my destination for the 
night at Diamond Lake

    <IMG src="photo_gallery/thumbnails/_190%20Diamond%20Lake%20trees.jpg" border="0" alt="_190 Diamond Lake trees" align="BOTTOM" width="200" height="149"></A>. I rented a small motor boat and went out on the lake

which has 5 huge snow capped mountains surrounding it.</p>
<p>Day 2. Left at 6:30 AM for <a href="http://www.nps.gov/crla/">Crater Lake</a>

    <IMG src="photo_gallery/thumbnails/_200%20Crater%20Lake%20Rim.jpg" border="0" alt="_200 Crater Lake Rim" align="BOTTOM" width="200" height="149"></A>. 
No one was manning the gate at 7:00, so I got in for free! I spent 5 hours at 
Crater Lake, towards the end I hiked down to the water.<A href="photo_gallery/pages/_210%20Crater%20Lake%20underwater%20rocks.htm" target="RightFrame"><IMG src="photo_gallery/thumbnails/_210%20Crater%20Lake%20underwater%20rocks.jpg" border="0" alt="_210 Crater Lake underwater rocks" align="BOTTOM" width="200" height="149"></A> Left Crater Lake at 
noon, drove all day through the trees to Reedsport, then up the coast

    <IMG src="photo_gallery/thumbnails/_255%20hug%20point.jpg" border="0" alt="_255 hug point" align="BOTTOM" width="200" height="149"></A> to 
Florence, where I stayed the night.</p>
<p>Day 3. Started up the coast at 7:00 AM, had pancakes for breakfast at a hotel 
restaurant after 3 hours of driving. Got to Sand Lake at 12:00 and met up with 
my cousin. Hung around and rode quads

rednecks

    <IMG src="photo_gallery/thumbnails/_250%20ready%20to%20go.jpg" border="0" alt="_250 ready to go" align="BOTTOM" width="200" height="149"></A> who always had a beer in their hand. Spent the night with them at their 
campsite in a trailer.</p>
<p>Day 4. Got up, rode some, and went to leave, but the Corvette is nowhere to 
be found. As we find out from a police officer, it had been towed a half hour 
earlier, because it was illegally parked in a day use only lot (this was not 
marked). My cousin and I drive to the garage and pick it up
	<A href="photo_gallery/pages/_corvette%20in%20garage.htm" target="RightFrame">
    <IMG src="photo_gallery/thumbnails/_corvette%20in%20garage.jpg" border="0" alt="_corvette in garage" align="BOTTOM" width="200" height="149"></A> for a $200 towing 
fee. I proceed to drive up the coast back to Astoria.</p>

<p>This data set contains 80X80 pixel JPEG images of Cellular Automata (CA). It 
includes 5 trials of length 100 - 200 (iterations) for each of the 4 classes of 
CA defined by Wolfram, extended to 2D CA.</p>
<p>5 trials for each of 4 classes</p>
<p>class 1: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; initial conditions: 80 X 80 grid, random with 60% bias </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rule: if less than 5 neighboring cells are on, turn 
current cell off, otherwise turn it on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>class 2: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; initial conditions: 80 X 80 grid, random with 30% bias </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rule: if less than 4 neighboring cells are on, turn 
current cell off, otherwise turn it on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>class 3:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; initial conditions: 40 X 40 grid, random with 30% bias </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rule: standard game of life rules:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>class 4:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; initial conditions: 47 X 47 grid, random with 50% bias </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rule: if number of neighboring cells that are on is even, 
turn the current cell on, if odd, turn current cell off</p>

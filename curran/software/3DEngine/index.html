<p><a href="test3D1/test3D.zip">the source (zip file)</a> test3DPanel.java is 
the one to mess with if you want to change the objects around</p>
<p>This is my second try at making a descent 3D engine in Java. It is fairly 
usable code-wise for anyone trying to do things in 3D, but it still could be 
much better. It includes the nice feature of having the objects free-spin after 
you rotate them with the mouse.</p>
<p>There is something wrong with the Z Sorting algorithm. It sorts the 3D 
polygons using the Z of the average point (calculated by averaging all of the 
corner points of the polygon) It seems like this should work ok but in certain 
situations it doesn't. Please
<a href="mailto:curran@paxtonmass.com?subject=Z Sorting">email me</a> if you 
have any suggestions for this.</p>

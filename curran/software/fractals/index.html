<p><font size="7">Fractals</font></p>
<p>I have endeavored to write these applets in order to better understand the 
nature of fractals.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="TreeFractal/TreeFractal.html">
<img border="0" src="../images/treefractal.gif" width="100" height="100"></a> A 
tree fractal, good for visualizing the concept of infinite complexity 
stemming (literally) from a single simple &quot;function&quot;. In this applet, you can 
modify the recursive rule in terms of the angle of branching and the size 
ratio between successive branches.</p>
<p><a href="koch/koch.htm"><img border="0" src="../images/koch.gif" width="100" height="111"></a>The Koch 
Curve. This curve when iterated infinitely is continuous but nowhere 
differentiable, has a finite area but and infinite perimeter. With particular 
settings, the tree fractal can achieve the same shape of the Koch Curve.

<p><a target="_blank" href="fractal_Mandlebrot/Fractal.html">
<img border="0" src="../images/fractal2.gif" width="100" height="100"></a>The 
Mandlebrot set; the iterative function Z<sub>n</sub> = Z<sub>(n+1)</sub>^2 + C 
mapped on the complex plane. Z is initially zero, and C is the point from which 
you start. In this example applet, the function is iterated 90 times for each 
pixel (each pixel represents a point on the complex plane, which is C in the 
function above.) The color is defined by how many iterations it takes for the new Z 
point to go further than 2 away from the origin. (is can be mathematically 
proven that once the point goes outside this bound, it will always go off to 
infinity. In this case, the point is not &quot;in the set&quot;) If Z does not go outside 
this bound after 90 iterations, it is assumed that it will never go off to 
infinity, and it is deemed &quot;in the set&quot; and colored black. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/2854/">fractal explorer </a>
explains fractals very well.</p>
<p><a href="illustrateLines/MSpiral_click.htm">
<img border="0" src="../images/MSpiral_click.gif" width="100" height="100"></a>This 
applet shows you what the computer is doing and where the iterations of the 
function go. when you move your mouse, it draws lines between the successive 
points given by iterating the function. Very interesting things happen inside 
the set towards the edges and inside the knobs. It looks like the knobs arise 
when the iterations loop back on themselves and form a &quot;stable&quot; geometric shape, 
and inside the knobs there are variations on that shape.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="fractal_red/Fractal.html">
<img border="0" src="../images/fractal1.gif" width="100" height="100"></a>This 
is the  function Z<sub>n</sub> = (Z<sub>(n+1)</sub>^2 + C)^2, which 
gives a totally different shape than Z<sub>(n+1)</sub>^2 + C.</p>

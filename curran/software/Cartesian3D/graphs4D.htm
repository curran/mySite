<p><font size="7">3D and 4D Cartesian Graphs</font></p>
<p>These graphs are visualizations of functions where Z = f(X,Y) (produces a 
still 3D surface) or Z = f(X,Y,Time) (produces a moving 3D surface)</p>
<p>All of these are rotatable using the mouse, click to start/stop time. Coming 
soon is a user-definable function grapher.</p>

4D function Z = sin(X*Y/10 + t)</p>

function resembling the interactions between two sources of waves in a liquid.</p>

<img border="0" src="../images/3Dcartesian_einsteinWarp.gif" width="100" height="100"></a>A 
4D function resembling Einstein's concept of gravity as warping spacetime. Here, 
the sun is the central dip, and the earth is the smaller dip which is orbiting 
the sun.</p>
<p>I have several projects in mind which build on this kind of programming:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A physical realization of a 4D function; an actual moving 
3D surface. This could be achieved by controlling a squarely arranged array of 
motors which each drive something up and down according to the function Z values 
at the given (X,Y) of the particular motor. Then if you put some kind of &quot;skin&quot; 
on the whole assembly, you would have a real moving 3D surface. I realize this 
kind of project has no real purpose except for the learning experience, but I 
believe it may be of interest to the art world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have the program rotate a curve about a given line. Then 
this program could be used to visualize calculus problems involving such 
rotation, and may be useful for high school calculus teachers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of defining each Z by a function, have all Z 
points dependent on surrounding points. So when one point is moved, that 
movement moves other points, which move other points etc. This may be used in 
the future to model actual physical things, like water or cloth.</p>
